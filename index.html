            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Gabriel Bundala a Full Stack Web Developer with an
              entrepreneurial passion and having deep roots in running business
              Operations and Financial reporting.
            </p>

            <p>
              I have been an auditor for more than 5 years and have recently
              moved into Operations which is more of an analytical role with the
              on the ground experience of business operations and management. I
              derive my motivation from building things.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most recently I have gained much interest in building software and
              it feels like my childhood dream of becoming a Civil Engineer has
              found the closest achievement. In the next years to come I would
              most likely officially change careers and move to Engineering
              roles however the longer term vision is to be an entrepreneur!

                My vision is to become an entrepreneur. I love building stuff
                and Civil Engineering had been my childhood dream because I
                thought that would provide me with the ability to design,
                architect and build structures (also because I love maths!). The
                only thing recently that has been a hindrance for me to build
                things is the Technical knowledge and experience in Web and
                Application development. With the great resources and curriculum
                at HyperionDev I have gained great knowledge, insights and
                experience in Full Stack Web Development due to the project
                based nature of the lessons and curriculum!
